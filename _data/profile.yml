  <p>
    I am a PhD Candidate in Civil & Environmental Engineering, at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    My research interest lies in uncertainty quantification for satellite-based precipitation data and its impact on hydrologic predictions. My study focuses on leveraging satellite products and physical or statistical models to address real-world challenges in areas with limited ground-based data. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities" target="_blank">FINESST</a>) 
    and a recipient of the 2024 <a href="https://www.agu.org/honors/horton-grant" target="_blank">AGU Horton Research Grant</a> .
    I am advised by Prof. Daniel Wright of <a href="https://her.cee.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">HER Research Group</a>.
