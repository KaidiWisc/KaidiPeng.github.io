    I am a PhD student in Civil & Environmental Engineering, at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. My research interest lies in satellite precipitation uncertainty quantification and associated effects in hydrologic predictions. I am also interested in hydrologic modeling uncertainty, and trying to convert the uncertainty into decision-making information. I am looking for approaches to leverage satellite products and physical/statistic models to solve real-world problems, especially in gauge-limited areas.
