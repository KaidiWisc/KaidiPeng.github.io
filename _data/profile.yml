  <p>
    I am a PhD student in Civil & Environmental Engineering, at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    My research interests lie in satellite precipitation uncertainty quantification and associated effects in hydrologic predictions. I am also interested in hydrologic modeling uncertainty and trying to convert the uncertainty into decision-making information. I am looking for approaches to leverage satellite products and physical/statistical models to solve real-world problems, especially in gauge-limited areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities" target="_blank">FINESST</a>). I am advised by Prof. Daniel Wright of <a href="https://her.cee.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">HER Research Group</a>.
